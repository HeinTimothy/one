        <p class="font-light">
          I was born in San Francisco and raised just outside silicon valley.
          Growing up I was exposed to CS early, building my first computer in elementary school
          and slowly continuing to expand my understanding of software and it's applications.
          In addition to computer science I was an avid swimmer, played rugby, and lead brass in my jazz band.
          Coming out of high school I was fortunate to study at Yale for a summer
          where I was exposed to many different cultures and grew to understand my own.
          To give back to the community my final year in school,
          I took the high position in boy scouts and lead my troop of ~150+ through one of our most active six months.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="font-light">
          I've gone on to study computer engineering at Purdue, continuing my experiences at Roble by taking on roles of responsability in our startup & accelerator ecosystem.
          A majority of my time is taken up by my own company with the rest split between learning and student groups.

          I always make the bandwidth to talk to other builders so if you're working on something: reach out!
          I'd love to hear about it and see what I can do.

        <p class="font-semibold">
          If you're not building I request a twitter DM with a book reccomendation. Cookbooks to philosophy, send me anything.
