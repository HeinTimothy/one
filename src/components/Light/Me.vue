          I dropped out my sophmore year because classes started and I realized I was learning so much more outside of lecture halls than in them.
          I have an intersting mix of professional experience where I've both built a handlful and web (and some web3) apps and
          spent a great deal of time studying the future of work & writing 'fantasy' investment memos on the companies I think will make it.
          I've never made noise about the things I build so to launch our waitlist I decided to start <a class="font-bold hover:underline" href="https://twitter.com/talltimofficial">building in public</a> on twitter.

        <div class="font-light my-2">
          Outside of work I have a love of coffee, skateboarding, and San Francisco ðŸŒ‰.
          You can sometimes catch me at web3 events but you'll most often find me in sketching figma.
